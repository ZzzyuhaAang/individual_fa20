    "Nowadays, city park is a great place to hang out for citizens in spare time. A lot of People like to spend some time getting close to the naturein parks with friends and families. There are some beautiful parks in San Diego. For some of them, pets are not allowed to enter, which means there are no pet facilities in those park. However, from the survey about pets population in San Diego, there is still a great amount of people who owns a dog or other kind of pets in San Diego. Nearly half of the families own a pet at home. They also need a place to walk their pets. If there are some special parks with pets facilities, it will be more attractive for those people to go to parks. Therefore, I want to know if more pet facilities in parks attract more visitors in San Diego.\n",

    "There are some exsiting projects around this topic:\n",
    "In the report, \"Dog walkers’ vs. other park visitors’ perceptions\", the thoughts of ordinary visitors and of those pets owners are compared. This report indicates that some of those facilities in parks are non-useable.<br>\n",
    "Also, in \"A tail of tails: The place of dog parks in the urban imaginary\", authors use Kansas city as an example to explore the relationship between dog parks and other ubran areas.\n",

    "For the questionaires I used in my data collecting, there may be some issues about it. Since my participants are randomly selected. It is really hard to come across 50 people who owns a pet and who is willing to take the questionaire. Some people may be reluctant to do the questionaire due to privacy concernes.<br>\n",
    "Plus, there may be some potentials bias since the result from the questionaires are subjective. Participants answer question with their own pespectives.<br>\n",
